# Student Management System

>This application was created using Spring web, MVC, Spring Data JDBC and utilized PostgreSql as the local database. This application
similates the system that would be used by a school for the management of the students. I have added the implementation to add, edit
and delete the students from the database. The application is run with Apache tomcat on your local browser. localhost:8080 is the 
default url where the application will be run. 

## Quick Start 

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Edit the application.properties to reflect the informmation for your local database
3. Ensure the connection with your database and the creation of the tables with your database
4. Run the application and navigate to localhost:8080/students on your browser to see the application running
